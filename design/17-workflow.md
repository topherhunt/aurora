## 17. Development workflow: desktop-first, headset-gated

> **Covers:** desktop-first development, the `npm run check` gate scripts, and the headset-gate protocol.
> **Read this when:** adding a check, or deciding whether something needs a headset before it counts as done.

**Iterate in Chrome on the desktop. Verify in the headset at gates.** Deploy-and-don-the-headset is a ~2 minute round trip against a ~2 second one, and most of this project's work -- procedural generation, placement aesthetics, LOD popping, terrain material, lighting, the aurora -- is judged with the eyes and reads fine on a monitor.

### What desktop tells you honestly

Silhouettes, colour, biome transitions, path layout, village siting, LOD pop distances, shadow softness, water shading, sky and aurora. Triangle counts and draw calls are also literally true -- they just need doubling to compare against a headset number.

### What desktop actively lies about

This list is why the gates exist, not a disclaimer:

| Lie | Why |
| --- | --- |
| **Fill rate** | Quest renders ~2× the pixels at a higher effective resolution and is fill-bound far more often than a desktop GPU. Alpha-tested foliage overdraw looks free on a monitor and is not |
| **Stereo cost** | Everything CPU-side and every draw call happens twice; there is no multiview in three.js (§5) |
| `discard` **cost** | The early-Z penalty from `alphaTest` is an Adreno tiler behaviour with no desktop analogue (§7) |
| **Thermals** | Minute 3 and minute 20 are different machines. Only a soak finds the cliff |
| **Foveation** | No desktop equivalent; it is real headroom that only appears on-device |
| **Scale and comfort** | Tree height, locomotion speed, snap-turn angle, gorge depth, vignette strength. **Not assessable on a monitor at all.** A mountain that reads as majestic on a screen can read as a hill in VR |

### Making the desktop HUD tell the truth

The §0 HUD stays on desktop and gets a budget line: **red past 350k triangles or 45 draw calls** (frame totals, matching the headset's `renderer.info`). Desktop then flags a budget breach the moment it happens, instead of hiding it behind a 200 fps monitor framerate. This converts most performance regressions into desktop-visible failures and shrinks what the gates have to catch to genuinely device-specific effects.

### Gates -- put on the headset when

1. A **new material or shader** enters the scene (fill-rate and `discard` behaviour are unmeasurable on desktop)
2. **Instance density or LOD distances** change materially
3. **Anything transparent or full-screen** is added -- snow particles, fog, aurora, vignette
4. Anything touching **locomotion, scale, or comfort** -- always, no exceptions, and judge by feel rather than by numbers
5. The end of **each §14 build step**, with a 20-minute soak at the last one before it gets handed over

A gate visit is a checklist, not a look-around: read frametime, worst-frame, draw calls, triangles, and the soak worst-case off the HUD, then toggle foveation to confirm the headroom is still there.
